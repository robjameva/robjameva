### Hi there 👋

Hi my name is Rob, I am a web developer from New Jersey who loves all things tech. I specialize in full stack JavaScript and have industry experience with Salesforce Apex.  Things I like include, building healthy habits, learning new things, and talking tech with fellow developers.

🌱 I’m currently learning React
💬 Ask me about getting a job as a self taught developer
